# Overview & ObjectivesProject Objective:
The primary objective was to leverage Generative AI (GenAI) prompts to quickly learn and implement a full-stack application using a new technology (Ruby on Rails). The resulting application, "StyleHaven," is an e-commerce catalogue demonstrating core shopping functionalities.
# Why This Tech Stack?
# Ruby on Rails: 
Chosen for its Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure and philosophy of Convention over Configuration.  This allowed for rapid scaffolding of a data-driven web application.
# TailwindCSS: 
A utility-first CSS framework used for efficient and modern styling. Its integration via the tailwindcss-rails gem demonstrates modern asset management techniques.
# End Goal
The final product is a fully functional, responsive catalogue that includes:25+ seeded products in the database.Interactive search (by name) and category filtering.A session-based shopping cart with total price calculation.
# II.  Features and Functionality
It has a search bar, filter bar, add to cart functionality and a product detail modal.
Functionality: the user can click add to cart and view the added items in the cart area.
# III. 💻System Requirements & Installation
System Requirements- RubyVersion 3.0 or higher
RailsVersion 7.0 or higher
Node.js & npmLatest stable version (Crucial for Tailwind)
#  Installation & Setup Steps (Including Debugging Fixes)
1. Initialize Rails Application & ModelBashrails new style_haven
cd style_haven
rails generate scaffold Product name:string price:decimal category:string description:text image_url:string
rails db:migrate
2. Fix Routing and Add Cart RouteEdit config/routes.rb to set the homepage and define the cart route:Ruby# config/routes.rb
root "products#index"
resources :products do
  collection do
    post :add_to_cart
  end
end
3. Establish Node/npm Environment (Error Fix)Fix: This step was crucial to resolve the dependency error caused by the missing package.json.Bashnpm init -y  # Creates the missing package.json
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
4. Install TailwindCSS IntegrationBashbundle add tailwindcss-rails
rails tailwindcss:install
5. Seed Database (25 Items)Bashrails db:seed
6. Run Application (Two Terminals Required)Terminal 1 (Compiler):Bash./bin/tailwindcss -i ./app/assets/stylesheets/application.tailwind.css -o ./app/assets/builds/tailwind.css --watch
Terminal 2 (Web Server):Bashrails server
